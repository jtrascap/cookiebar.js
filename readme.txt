Cookie

To use Cookie Bar simply add a link to the JavaScript to the bottom of your document (before the closing </body>):

<script type="text/javascript" src="cookiebar.jquery.min.js"></script>

â€¦then add the following meta tag to your document head:

<meta property="cb:url" content="/privacy-policy" />

Change the 'content' value of the meta tag to reflect the location of your privacy policy document. That's it - you're done!
