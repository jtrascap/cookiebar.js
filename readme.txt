To use Cookie Bar simply add a link to the JavaScript to the bottom of your document (before the closeing </body>) and then add the following meta tag to your document head:

<meta property="cb:url" content="/privacy-policy"/>

Change the 'content' value of the meta tag to reflect the location of your privacy policy document. That's it - you're done!
